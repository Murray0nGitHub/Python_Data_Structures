#You are making a call center application, which should handle customers in a queue.
#The CallCenter class is implemented as a Queue. Each element of the queue has the topic of the call as its value. The two possible values are 'general' and 'technical'. A 'general' call takes on average 5 minutes to handle, while a 'technical' call requires 10 minutes.
#The given code adds multiple customers to the Queue from user input.
#You need to dequeue all added customers, calculate and output the total time required to handle all calls.
#Use a while loop to dequeue all the customers from the queue, until it is empty.
